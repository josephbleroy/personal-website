# GRC Engineering

Automating AWS compliance controls that reduce audit friction and improve security.

## About This Content

This is my learning journey documenting practical AWS GRC Engineering implementations. The focus is on automation that helps during audits while making companies more secure—not just checking compliance boxes.

Each tutorial provides:
- **Step-by-step implementation guides** for AWS compliance controls
- **Working Infrastructure-as-Code** (OpenTofu) that you can deploy
- **Compliance mapping** to multiple frameworks (PCI DSS, SOC 2, and others)
- **Validation steps** to verify controls are working
- **Real-world context** from hands-on PCI DSS and SOC 2 experience

## Tutorial Series

### AWS Foundations for Compliance

Building a compliant AWS foundation from scratch—the prerequisites for implementing security controls.

**Coming soon:**
1. AWS Organizations & Account Structure
2. AWS IAM Identity Center Setup

### AWS Access Control for Compliance

*Future series on implementing least privilege, policy boundaries, and access monitoring*

## Frameworks Covered

- **PCI DSS v4.0** - Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard
- **SOC 2 Trust Services Criteria** - Security, Availability, and Confidentiality controls
- **Future additions**: NIST 800-53, CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark

## Code Repository

All tutorials include complete, tested OpenTofu code available at:

**[github.com/josephbleroy/aws-grc-engineering](https://github.com/josephbleroy/aws-grc-engineering)** *(repository will be created when first tutorial is published)*
