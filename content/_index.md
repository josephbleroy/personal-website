I'm Joe LeRoy—I help engineering teams build security and compliance into their workflow instead of around it.

I've helped build security programs at a Tokyo-based startup (later acquired by a major fintech) and continue supporting their operations remotely from the Philadelphia Metro Area.

My focus now is bridging security engineering with GRC automation so compliance actually makes you secure, not just compliant.
