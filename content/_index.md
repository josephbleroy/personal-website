I'm a Cybersecurity & GRC Lead currently living in the Philadelphia Metro Area. I spent time working in Tokyo for a startup (acquired by a major fintech) and continue to support operations there. I bridge the gap between security and business growth, translating technical risks into clear strategies. My focus is building comprehensive security programs that integrate cloud security, vulnerability management, and compliance frameworks to enable innovation rather than hinder it.
