I'm a GRC Engineer splitting time between Philadelphia and Tokyo. I bridge the gap between security and business growth, translating technical risks into clear strategies. My focus is building comprehensive security programs that integrate cloud security, vulnerability management, and compliance frameworks to enable innovation rather than hinder it.
