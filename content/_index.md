Greetings. This is Joe LeRoy. I’m a Cybersecurity & GRC Lead, engineer, and strategist.

My focus is bridging the gap between hands-on engineering and strategy. I help teams achieve GRC goals by removing friction—improving velocity, trust, and security.

Currently, I live in the Philadelphia Metro Area, though I spent time working in Tokyo for a startup (acquired by a major fintech) and continue to support operations there.

Previously: I've built comprehensive security programs in fast-paced environments. I specialize in translating technical realities into clear business strategies, ensuring compliance enables innovation rather than hinders it.
