Greetings. This is Joe LeRoy. I’m a Cybersecurity & GRC Lead, engineer, and strategist.

As a security leader, I bridge the gap between technical risk and business growth. My focus is building comprehensive security programs that enable innovation rather than hinder it.

Currently, I live in the Philadelphia Metro Area, though I spent time working in Tokyo for a startup (acquired by a major fintech) and continue to support operations there.

Previously: I've led security initiatives in fast-paced environments, translating complex technical concepts into clear business strategies. I specialize in making security a business enabler, ensuring companies can move fast while staying secure.
