I'm Joe LeRoy—I help engineering teams build security and compliance into their workflow instead of around it.

I'm a Cybersecurity & GRC Lead with a background in security engineering, operations, and leading external and internal audits. I work with engineering managers to translate compliance requirements into practical systems and automate the manual parts of GRC.

I built security programs from the ground up at a Tokyo-based startup (later acquired by a major fintech) and continue supporting their operations remotely from the Philadelphia Metro Area.

My focus now is bridging security engineering with GRC automation so compliance actually makes you secure, not just compliant.
